1.	Results: 
•	Data Preprocessing
o	What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
	Successful column in the data frame is the targeted variable
o	What variable(s) are the features for your model?
	The data frame fields are the other variables
o	What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
	The dropped columns are EIN and NAME
•	Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
o	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
	Layer 1 was 8 and layer 2 is 5
o	Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
	The accuracy of the model was 72%
o	What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
	I added more layers and nodes in hopes of a higher model accuracy
3.	Summary: Possibly more data clean up could increase the accuracy and finding a model with a greater correlation between input and outputs
